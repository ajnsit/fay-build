fay-build
=========

A Build System For Fay (Haskell) Code. It merges multiple modules together into
one build file and can compress the output using closure compiler (included).
The Fay runtime is included only once to save space.

Not much documentation right now. Simply run Build.sh with the --help flag. You
would need Haskell and Fay installed of course. You would also need java if you
wish to compress the output.

Run test.sh to see an example.
